    "1). what is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "Answer--Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently within a single process.\n",
    "A thread is the smallest unit of a CPU's execution, and multithreading allows for better utilization of a computer's resources,\n",
    "especially in cases where a program needs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously or handle multiple I/O-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads share the same memory space within a process, which means they can easily exchange data and communicate with each other.\n",
    "Multithreading is used primarily for two purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: Multithreading allows a program to achieve concurrency, which means multiple tasks can appear to be executing simultaneously\n",
    "Parallelism: Although Python's \n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts true parallel execution of threads due to limitations in CPython's memory management, multithreading can still be useful in certain scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading. This module provides a high-level interface for creating and working with threads. \n",
    "It includes classes and functions to create and manage threads, handle synchronization, and manage thread-local data. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why threading module used? Write the use of the following functions\n",
    "(A) activeCount\n",
    "(B) currentThread\n",
    "(C) enumerate\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--The threading module in Python is used to create and manage threads within a single process. \n",
    "It provides a way to achieve concurrency, where multiple threads appear to execute simultaneously and share the same memory space\n",

    "run\n",
    "start\n",
    "join\n",
    "isAlive()\n",
    "Answer--run():\n",
    "The run() method is the entry point for the thread's activity. You can subclass the Thread class and override this method with the code that you want the thread to execute. \n",
    "When you start a thread using the start() method, it calls the run() method of that thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "b--start():\n",
    "The start() method starts the execution of a thread. It allocates system resources, schedules the thread for execution, and calls the thread's run() method.\n",

    "c--join():\n",
    "The join() method blocks the calling thread until the thread on which it's called completes its execution. \n",
